/**
 * Combinations of one or more elements that evaluate to single {@link java.lang.Object} value.
 * The following is adapted from Filter encoding specifications:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-026r2/09-026r2.html">OGC® Filter Encoding 2.0 Encoding Standard</a></li>
 *   <li><a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=5929">OpenGIS® Catalogue Service Implementation Specification 2.0.1</a></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>An <cite>expression</cite> can be formed using the elements:
 * {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Add}, {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Subtract},
 * {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Multiply}, {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Divide},
 * {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.PropertyName}, {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Literal}
 * and {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Function}. They all belong to the substitution group
 * expression which means that any of them can be used wherever an expression is called for. In addition,
 * the combinaison of these elements are themselves expressions and can be used wherever an expression is
 * called for.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Arithmetic operators</h3>
 * <p>The elements defined in this package are used to encode the fundamental arithmetic operations of addition,
 * subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic operators are binary operators meaning that they accept
 * two arguments and evaluate to a single result.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Literals</h3>
 * <p>A literal value is any part of a statement or expression that is to be used exactly as it is specified,
 * rather than as a variable or other element. The {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Literal} element is used
 * to encode literal scalar and geometric values.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Functions</h3>
 * <p>A function is a named procedure that performs a distinct computation.
 * A function may accept zero or more arguments as input and generates a single result.
 * A function is composed of the name of the function, encoded using the attribute name, and zero or more arguments
 * contained within the {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.Function} element.
 * The arguments themselves are {@linkplain org.opengis.filter.expression.Expression expressions}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Data Access</h3>
 * <p>Data access is accomplished by means of {@link org.opengis.filter.expression.PropertyName} expressions.
 * These Expressions are independent of the data being queried and form the foundation of a, very simple, general
 * query language offering independence specific bindings to Feature, Metadata and Record data structures.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Filter Encodings</h3>
 * <p>At the time of this writing the Filter API has standard encodings for XML (Filter 1.0 and Filter 1.1)
 * and Text (a BNF form is provided in the Catalog 2.0.1 specification above). You should be warned that not
 * all content can be expressed in all encodings, please refer to the javadocs for specific limitations.</p>
