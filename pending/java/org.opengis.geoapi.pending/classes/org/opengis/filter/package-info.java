/**
 * Filters {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.Feature features} according their properties.
 * A <cite>filter expression</cite> is a construct used to constraints the property
 * values of an object type for the purpose of identifying a subset of object instances
 * to be operated upon in some manner.
 *
 * The following is adapted from the <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-026r2/09-026r2.html">OGCÂ®
 * Filter Encoding 2.0 Encoding Standard</a>:
 *
 * <h3>Comparison operators</h3>
 * <p>A comparison operator is used to form expressions that evaluate the mathematical comparison between two arguments.
 * If the arguments satisfy the comparison then the expression {@linkplain org.opengis.filter.Filter#evaluate evaluates}
 * to {@code true}. Otherwise the expression evaluates to {@code false}.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition to the standard set ({@code =}, {@code <}, {@code >}, {@code >=}, {@code <=}, {@code <>})
 * of comparison operators, this package defines the elements {@link org.opengis.filter.PropertyIsLike},
 * {@link org.opengis.filter.PropertyIsBetween} and {@link org.opengis.filter.PropertyIsNull}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Logical operators</h3>
 * <p>A logical operator can be used to combine one or more conditional expressions.
 * The logical operator {@link org.opengis.filter.And} evaluates to {@code true} if all the combined
 * expressions evaluate to {@code true}. The operator {@link org.opengis.filter.Or} operator evaluates
 * to {@code true} is any of the combined expressions evaluate to {@code true}.
 * The {@link org.opengis.filter.Not} operator reverses the logical value of an expression.
 * The elements {@code And}, {@code Or} and {@code Not} can be used to combine scalar,
 * spatial and other logical expressions to form more complex compound expressions.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Identity</h3>
 * <p>Identity can be checked using {@link org.opengis.filter.Id}, selected objects
 * will are matched against a set of {@link org.opengis.filter.identiy.Identifier}.</p>
