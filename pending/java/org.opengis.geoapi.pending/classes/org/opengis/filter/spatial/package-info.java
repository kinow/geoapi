/**
 * Determines whether a spatial operation geometric arguments satisfy the stated spatial relationship.
 * The operator {@linkplain org.opengis.filter.Filter#evaluate evaluates} to {@code true} if the spatial
 * relationship is satisfied. Otherwise the operator evaluates to {@code false}.
 *
 * The following is adapted from the <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/09-026r2/09-026r2.html">OGCÂ®
 * Filter Encoding 2.0 Encoding Standard</a>:
 *
 * <p>{@linkplain org.opengis.filter.spatial.SpatialOperator Spatial operators} are used to test whether
 * the value of a geometric property, potentially referenced using the name of the property, and a
 * (potentially literal) geometric value satisfy the spatial relationship implied by the operator.
 * For example, the {@link org.opengis.filter.spatial.Overlaps} operator evaluates whether the value
 * of the specified geometric property and the specified literal geometric value spatially overlap.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.opengis.filter.spatial.BBOX} element is defined as a convenient and more compact
 * way of encoding the very common bounding box constraint based on the {@code gml:Box} geometry.
 * The {@code BBOX} operator should identify all geometries that spatially interact with the box in some manner.</p>
 *
 * <p>The spatial operators {@link org.opengis.filter.spatial.DWithin} and {@link org.opengis.filter.spatial.Beyond}
 * test whether the value of a geometric property is within or beyond a specified distance of the specified literal
 * geometric value. Distance values are expressed using the
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.filter.spatial.DistanceBufferOperator#getDistance distance} attribute.
 * The content of the distance attribute represents the magnitude of the distance and the
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.filter.spatial.DistanceBufferOperator#getDistanceUnits units}
 * attribute is used to specify the units of measure.</p>
