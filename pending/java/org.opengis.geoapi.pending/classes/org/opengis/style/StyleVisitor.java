/**
 * An interface for classes that want to perform operations on a Style
 * hierarchy. It forms part of a GoF Visitor Pattern implementation.
 *
 * <p>A call to style.accept(StyleVisitor) will result in a call to one of the
 * methods in this interface. The responsibility for traversing sub filters is
 * intended to lie with the visitor (this is unusual, but permitted under the
 * Visitor pattern).</p>
 *
 * <p>A typical use would be to transcribe a style into a specific format, e.g. XML or SQL.
 * Alternatively it may be to extract specific information from the Style structure, for example a list of all fills.
 * Finally a a style visitor is often used (in conjunction with a factory) in the production of a
 * copy; or slightly modified copy of the original style.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is common practice for a StyleVisitor to also implement an ExpressionVisitor in
 * order to traverse both data structures.</p>
