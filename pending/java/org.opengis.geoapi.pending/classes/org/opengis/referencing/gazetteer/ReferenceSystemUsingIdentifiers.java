/**
 * Spatial reference system using geographic identifiers instead than coordinates for describing locations.
 * A spatial reference system using geographic identifiers shall comprise at least one location types.
 * Each location instance shall be uniquely identified by means of a geographic identifier.
 * A spatial reference system using geographic identifiers shall be minimally described by the following attributes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>name</li>
 *   <li>theme</li>
 *   <li>overall owner</li>
 *   <li>territory of use</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Spatial reference systems shall be immutable: a new version of the spatial reference system shall be created
 * whenever any {@link LocationType} is created or destroyed, or a new version of a {@code LocationType} is created.
 * The version reference is included in the {@linkplain #getName() name} of the spatial reference system.
 *
 * @departure rename
 *   The name has been shortened by omitting the <code>Spatial</code> and <code>Geographic</code> parts of the name.
 *   This is consistent with the change of <code>getDomainOfValidity()</code> return type, which had to be relaxed
 *   from geographic extent to more generic extent.
