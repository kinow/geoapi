/**
 * Mapping between geographic identifiers and locations, either as descriptions or coordinates.
 * This package deals only with spatial referencing by <em>geographic identifiers</em>,
 * as specified in the {@linkplain org.opengis.annotation.Specification#ISO_19112 ISO 19112} standard.
 * Spatial referencing <em>by coordinates</em> (ISO 19111) is the subject of another package,
 * namely {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs}.
 *
 * <p>Geographic identifiers are location descriptors such as country name, postal code or grid indexes.
 * Gazetteers provide linking mechanism between referencing using geographic identifiers (this package)
 * and referencing using coordinates ({@link org.opengis.referencing.crs} package).</p>
