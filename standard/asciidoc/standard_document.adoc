    .foo        Title associated to a paragraph, list, table or figure. Must be above the element.
    foo +       Line break (+ must be at the end of line).
    <<<         Page break.

Block (must start and end with the same sequence of characters):

    ----        Source code.
    ****        Aside text and content displayed outside the flow of the document.

Around words:
