[CAUTION]
====
The use of `org.opengis.util.CodeList` constructs includes accessing statically defined elements,
defining new elements and retrieving any element defined for the code list.
Considering, for example, `org.​opengis.​referencing.​cs.​AxisDirection`,
the following code could be used:

[source,java]
----
AxisDirection north    = AxisDirection.NORTH;
AxisDirection northBis = AxisDirection.valueOf("NORTH");
----

where the second locution will create a new value if it does not exist.
Special care should be taken to keep such calls consistent throughout the code
since the `CodeList` will create a new element if there are any difference in the `String` parameters.
