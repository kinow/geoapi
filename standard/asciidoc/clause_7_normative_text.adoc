[[requirements]]
== Requirements
This section describes requirements for ensuring source compatibility or binary compatibility
(when applicable) of libraries compliant with this specification.
Those requirements apply to the _libraries_ made available for use by other developers.
The requirements usually do not apply to final products distributed to end users.
For example compliant libraries shall obey to method signatures declared in published OGC interfaces,
otherwise other developers could not base their developments on a common set of API.
However the final product is free to modify, add or remove methods as it sees fit;
if the GeoAPI of the final product is not invoked by any external application,
then changes to that API has no impact on inter-operability.
