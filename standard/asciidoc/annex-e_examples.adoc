[[UML-introspection]]
=== UML at runtime

The <<annotations,annotations in API>> are available at runtime by introspection.
This is useful, for example, when code needs to marshall data using the name defined by the ISO standard rather than the GeoAPI name.


[[UML-java]]
==== Java example

At runtime, the annotation of a reference to a GeoAPI interface can be obtained as follows,
taking as an example the method `getTitle()` in the `Citation` type:

[source,java]
----
Class<?>      type          = Citation.class;
Method        method        = type.getMethod("getTitle");
UML           annotation    = method.getAnnotation(UML.class);
String        identifier    = annotation.identifier();          // = "title"
Specification specification = annotation.specification();       // = ISO 19115-1
Obligation    obligation    = annotation.obligation();          // = mandatory
----

Java provides a class instance like the `Citation.class` instance used here for every type, either interface or class, defined in the runtime.
The `getMethod(…)` call uses introspection to obtain a reference to the method from which the annotation can then be obtained.
The annotation system therefore provides access, at runtime, to the original definition of the element.
