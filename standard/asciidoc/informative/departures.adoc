=== Departure from ISO 19103


GeoAPI differs from ISO 19103 in the following ways:

* Replace some ISO 19103 types by equivalent standard types of the target platform when they exist.
* Introduction of a `ControlledVocabulary` type as a common parent for code lists and enumerations.
* Use of `InternationalString` for holding a separate `String` for every locale to handle.
* Introduction of a `NameFactory` for providing constructors to instantiate `GenericName` objects.
