==== Name types
[.reference]_From ISO 19103:2015 §7.5_

A name is a sequence of identifiers rooted within the context of a namespace.
`NameSpace` defines a domain in which "names" given by character strings can be mapped to objects.
For example a class forms a namespace for the properties that the class contains.
While ISO 19103 defines mapping functions from a name to the object identified by that name,
these mapping functions are not part of the `NameSpace` interface defined by GeoAPI.
These mappings are left to other frameworks (for example _Java Naming and Directory Interface_).

|`NameSpace`    |`org.opengis.util.NameSpace`   |
|`GenericName`  |`org.opengis.util.GenericName` |
|`ScopedName`   |`org.opengis.util.ScopedName`  |
|`LocalName`    |`org.opengis.util.LocalName`   |

|`MemberName`   |`org.opengis.util.MemberName`  |
|===========================================================

`GenericName` is the base type for all names in a `NameSpace`.
A generic name can be either a `LocalName`, or a `ScopedName` which is a composite of
a `LocalName` (the _head_) for locating another `NameSpace` and a `GenericName` (the _tail_) valid in that name space.
`TypeName` and `MemberName` are subtypes of `LocalName`
for referencing a type (for example a class) and a member (for example a property in a class) respectively.
The `NameFactory` is an extension of the GeoAPI project designed to allow the construction of instances of these name types.

GeoAPI extends the ISO 19103 model by adding a (_path_, _tip_) pair in complement to the (_head_, _tail_) pair.
While the _head_ and _tip_ properties carry non-trivial information only inside `ScopedName`,
GeoAPI nevertheless makes them available from the `GenericName` interface (not shown in above diagram)
with the restriction that they shall return `this` (Java) or `self` (Python) when the name is an instance of `LocalName`.
This generalization makes common operations simpler without the need to check for the exact name type.

The ISO 19103 `aName` property appears as `toString` in above UML diagram,
but this property should be mapped to the standard mechanism for representing an arbitrary object
as a character string in the target programming language.
In Java this is the `toString()` method;
in Python this is `+__str__+` or `+__repr__+`.
This specification uses the Java method name as it is more readable, but other languages should adapt.
