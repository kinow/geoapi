 * Tests <cite>Well-Known Text</cite> (WKT) parsing.
 * Each {@code *ParserTest} class in this package tests a factory method implemented by the product to test.
 * The factory method is given various WKT strings provided by the international standard defining the WKT format.
 * The tests verify that the objects returned by the factory method have the expected values.
 *
 * <p>The methods tested by this package and the corresponding international standards are:</p>
