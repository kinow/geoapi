/**
 * The kind of calculation that produced the {@link DirectPosition}s being compared.
 * This enumeration is expected by all {@code assertCoordinateEquals(…)} methods in the
 * {@link TransformTestCase} class. The enumeration values are consumed by the following
 * methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link TransformTestCase#normalize(DirectPosition, DirectPosition, CalculationType)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link ToleranceModifier#adjust(double[], DirectPosition, CalculationType)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For example if a precision of 10 centimetres is requested for a map projection, then that
 * tolerance threshold must be converted from metres to decimal degrees (approximatively 1E-6°)
 * when testing the inverse projection. This enumeration allows {@link ToleranceModifier}
 * implementations to know when such conversion is needed.
