/**
 * The GeoAPI conformance testing framework. This package does not provide any test by itself,
 * but provides the base classes for all tests defined in sub-packages.
 * The classes in this package can be grouped in 6 categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p><b>Test cases</b><br>
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.TestCase} is the base class of all GeoAPI tests. Implementors can extend directly
 *       the {@code TestCase} subclasses of their choice for gaining some control, for example in order to specify
 *       whether {@linkplain org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase#isDerivativeSupported math transform
 *       derivatives are supported} by their implementation.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>Test suite</b><br>
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.TestSuite} groups all GeoAPI {@code TestCases} in a single point. This is not the
 *       easiest class to use since implementations typically support only a subset of GeoAPI functionalities. But
 *       {@code TestSuite} can provide some help for implementors defining their own test suite.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>Validation</b><br>
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.Validators} class provides static {@code validate(â€¦)} methods that can be used for
 *       validating existing instances of various kinds. Those methods can be conveniently imported in a test class
 *       with the following Java statement:</p>
 *
 *       <blockquote><pre>import static org.opengis.test.Validators.*;</pre></blockquote>
 *
 *       <p>{@link org.opengis.test.Validator} and {@link org.opengis.test.ValidatorContainer} are support classes for
 *       the above, but usually do not need to be considered unless the validation process needs to be customized.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>Assertions</b><br>
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.Assert} extends {@link org.junit.Assert org.junit.Assert} class with additional
 *       assertion methods.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>Configuration</b><br>
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.Configuration}, {@link org.opengis.test.CalculationType},
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.ToleranceModifier}, {@link org.opengis.test.FactoryFilter} and
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.ImplementationDetails} allow implementors to alter the tests.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p><b>Events</b><br>
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.TestListener}, {@link org.opengis.test.TestEvent} and
 *       {@link org.opengis.test.ComputationFailure} allow implementors to be notified about test executions,
 *       successes or failures.</p></li>
 * </ul>
