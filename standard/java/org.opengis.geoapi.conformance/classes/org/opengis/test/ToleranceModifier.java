/**
 * Modifies the tolerance threshold before to compare a calculated value against its expected value.
 * When a {@link TestCase} is run, GeoAPI performs the following steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Scan every {@link ImplementationDetails} on the classpath and invoke their
 *       {@link ImplementationDetails#tolerance(MathTransform) tolerance(…)}
 *       method for the {@link MathTransform} being tested.</li>
 *
 *   <li>For each non-null {@code ToleranceModifier}, invoke the {@link #adjust(double[],
 *       DirectPosition, CalculationType) adjust(…)} method. The first given argument will be
 *       the default tolerance thresholds computed by the {@link TestCase} being run. Implementation
 *       can modify those tolerances in an arbitrary number of dimensions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Different implementations are available for different cases. For example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Allowing a greater tolerance threshold along the vertical axis compared to the
 *       horizontal axis.</li>
 *   <li>In a geographic CRS, ignoring offsets of 360° in longitude.</li>
 *   <li>In a geographic CRS, ignoring the longitude value if the latitude is at a pole.</li>
 * </ul>
