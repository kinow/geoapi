/**
 * Validators and test suites for the {@code org.opengis.referencing} package. The validator classes
 * don't need to be used directly (use the static {@link org.opengis.test.Validators} methods instead),
 * unless implementors want to alter the way referencing objects are validated.
 *
 * <p>This package provides a {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase} base class
 * with methods for testing {@link org.opengis.referencing.operation.MathTransform} instances.
 * The various {@code TransformTestCase} fields control different aspects of the test to be run,
 * like the {@linkplain org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase#tolerance tolerance}
 * threshold for comparing ordinate values or whether
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase#isDerivativeSupported math transform
 * derivatives are supported}. Implementors can extend this class in order to define their own
 * tests.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.ObjectFactoryTest},
 * {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.AuthorityFactoryTest},
 * {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.ParameterizedTransformTest} and other concrete classes can
 * also be extended by implementors in order to inherit pre-defined test cases. Many of those test
 * cases are derived from publications of authoritative sources like EPSG or national mapping
 * agencies. By extending the test classes directly, implementors can control which factories
 * are used and alter the way the tests are performed as documented in the above-cited
 * {@link org.opengis.test.referencing.TransformTestCase} class.</p>
