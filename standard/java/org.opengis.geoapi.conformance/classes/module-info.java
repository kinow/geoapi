/**
 * Test suites for GeoAPI implementations.
 * The GeoAPI conformance module provides three kinds of Java classes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain org.opengis.test.Validators} for testing the conformance of
 *     existing instances of GeoAPI interfaces.</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain org.opengis.test.TestCase} as the base class of all JUnit tests
 *     in this module, which can be extended by developers on a case-by-case basis.</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain org.opengis.test.TestSuite} as the aggregation of all JUnit tests
 *     defined in this module.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Implementors can alter the tests, for example in order to disable testing of some unsupported features,
 * either by extending directly the appropriate {@code TestCase} subclass (easiest way),
 * or by providing {@linkplain org.opengis.test.ImplementationDetails implementation details} in a central place.
 * See the <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/geoapi-conformance/index.html">web site</a> for examples.
 *
 * @version 4.0
 * @since 2.2
