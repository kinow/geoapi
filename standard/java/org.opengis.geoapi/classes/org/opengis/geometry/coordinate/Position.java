/**
 * A type consisting of either a {@linkplain DirectPosition direct position} or of a
 * {@linkplain Point point} from which a {@linkplain DirectPosition direct position}
 * shall be obtained. The use of this data type allows the identification of a position
 * either directly as a coordinate (variant direct) or indirectly as a {@linkplain Point point}
 * (variant indirect).
 *
 * @departure constraint
 *   ISO 19107 defines {@code Position} as a {@code union} of {@code DirectPosition} and {@code Point}
 *   but unions are not allowed in Java. GeoAPI defines {@code Position} as the base interface of both
 *   types so the two conditional accessor methods, {@code getPoint()} and {@code getDirectPosition()},
 *   can be replaced by an {@code instanceof} check. However, the {@code getDirectPosition()} has been
 *   retained with different semantics, conceptually returning a {@code DirectPosition} at the same location.
 *   The conditionality has also been changed to mandatory since all three types conceptually have a
 *   well defined location.
