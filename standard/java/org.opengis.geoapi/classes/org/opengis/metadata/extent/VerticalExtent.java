/**
 * Vertical domain of resource.
 *
 * @departure integration
 *   ISO 19115 provides two ways to define a coordinate reference system,
 *   with the restriction that only one of those two ways can be used:
 *   <ol>
 *     <li>{@code verticalCRS}   of type {@code SC_VerticalCRS}     (from ISO 19111),</li>
 *     <li>{@code verticalCRSId} of type {@code MD_ReferenceSystem} (from ISO 19115).</li>
 *   </ol>
 *   GeoAPI provides only the first way, because the {@code MD_ReferenceSystem} type
 *   has been intentionally omitted in order to have a single CRS framework (the ISO 19111 one).
