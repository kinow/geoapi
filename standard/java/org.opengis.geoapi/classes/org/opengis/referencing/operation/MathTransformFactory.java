/**
 * Low level factory for creating {@code MathTransform} instances.
 * Many high level GIS applications will never need to use this factory directly;
 * they can use a {@linkplain CoordinateOperationFactory coordinate operation factory} instead.
 * However, the {@code MathTransformFactory} interface can be used directly
 * by applications that wish to transform other types of coordinates
 * (e.g. color coordinates, or image pixel coordinates).
 *
 * <p>A {@link MathTransform} is an object that actually does the work of applying {@link Formula} to coordinate values.
 * The math transform does not know or care how the coordinates relate to positions in the real world.
 * This lack of semantics makes implementing {@code MathTransformFactory} significantly easier
 * than it would be otherwise.</p>
 *
 * <p>For example the affine transform applies a matrix to the coordinates
 * without knowing how what it is doing relates to the real world.
 * So if the matrix scales <var>z</var> values by a factor of 1000, then it could be
 * converting metres into millimetres, or it could be converting kilometres into metres.</p>
 *
 * <p>Because {@link MathTransform}s have low semantic value (but high mathematical value),
 * programmers who do not have much knowledge of how GIS applications use coordinate systems,
 * or how those coordinate systems relate to the real world, can implement {@code MathTransformFactory}.
 * The low semantic content of {@link MathTransform}s also means that they will be useful in applications
 * that have nothing to do with GIS coordinates. For example, a math transform could be used to map color
 * coordinates between different color spaces, such as converting (red, green, blue) colors into
 * (hue, light, saturation) colors.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since a {@link MathTransform} does not know what its source and target coordinate systems mean,
 * it is not necessary or desirable for a math transform object to keep information on its source and
 * target coordinate systems.</p>

     * <h2>Note on cartographic projections:</h2>
     * Cartographic projection transforms are used by {@linkplain ProjectedCRS projected coordinate reference systems}
     * to map geographic coordinates (e.g. <var>longitude</var> and <var>latitude</var>) into (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>)
     * coordinates. These (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) coordinates can be imagined to lie on a plane, such as a paper map
     * or a screen. All cartographic projection transforms created through this constructor will have the following
     * properties:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Converts from (<var>longitude</var>,<var>latitude</var>) coordinates to (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>).</li>
     *   <li>All angles are assumed to be degrees, and all distances are assumed to be meters.</li>
     *   <li>The domain shall be a subset of {[-180,180)×(-90,90)}.</li>
     *   <li>Axis directions are usually ({@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.AxisDirection#EAST east},
     *       {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.AxisDirection#NORTH north}), but exceptions may exist
     *       for some operation methods like <cite>"Lambert Conic Conformal (West Orientated)"</cite>
     *       (EPSG:9826) or <cite>"Transverse Mercator (South Orientated)"</cite> (EPSG:9808).</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * Although all cartographic projection transforms must have the properties listed above, many projected coordinate
     * reference systems have different properties. For example, in Europe some projected CRSs use grads instead of degrees,
     * and often the {@linkplain ProjectedCRS#getBaseCRS() base geographic CRS} is (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>)
     * instead of (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>). This means that the cartographic projected transform is often
     * used as a single step in a series of transforms, where the other steps change units and swap ordinates.
     *
     * <p>When the change of axis directions is part of the map projection definition as in <cite>"Transverse Mercator
     * (South Orientated)"</cite>, there is a conflict with the above-cited (<var>east</var>, <var>north</var>) directions.
     * In such cases the {@code createParameterizedTransform(…)} behavior is implementation specific, since different
     * libraries may resolve this conflict in different ways.
     * Users can invoke {@link #createBaseToDerived createBaseToDerived(…)} instead for more determinist results.</p>
