/**
 * A 3-dimensional coordinate system with one distance measured from the origin and two angular ordinates.
 * Not to be confused with an {@link EllipsoidalCS} based on an ellipsoid "degenerated" into a sphere.
 *
 * <p>This type of CS can be used by coordinate reference systems of type
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.GeocentricCRS} or
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.EngineeringCRS}.
 * The following examples describe some possible set of axes for spherical CS used with the above-cited CRS:</p>
 *
 * <table class="ogc">
 *   <caption>Example 1: used with a Geocentric CRS</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Axis name</th> <th>Abbr.</th> <th>Direction</th> <th>Unit</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Spherical latitude</td> <td>Θ</td> <td>{@link AxisDirection#NORTH}</td> <td>degree</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Spherical longitude</td><td>Ω</td> <td>{@link AxisDirection#EAST}</td>  <td>degree</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Geocentric radius</td>  <td>R</td> <td>{@link AxisDirection#UP}</td>    <td>metre</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <table class="ogc">
 *   <caption>Example 2: used with an Engineering CRS</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Axis name</th> <th>Abbr.</th> <th>Direction</th> <th>Unit</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Distance</td>  <td>r</td> <td>{@code AxisDirection.valueOf("AWAY_FROM")}</td>         <td>kilometre</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Longitude</td> <td>φ</td> <td>{@code AxisDirection.valueOf("COUNTER_CLOCKWISE")}</td> <td>degree</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Elevation</td> <td>Θ</td> <td>{@link AxisDirection#UP}</td>                           <td>degree</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * The above example uses two axis directions that are not defined in ISO 19111,
 * but found in ISO 19162 as "{@code awayFrom}" and "{@code counterClockwise}".</div>
