/**
 * Base type of all Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS).
 * This is the base interface for two cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link SingleCRS}, defined by a
 *       {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.cs.CoordinateSystem coordinate system} and a
 *       {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum datum};</li>
 *   <li>{@link CompoundCRS}, defined as a sequence of {@code SingleCRS}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Purpose</h3>
 * A coordinate reference system (CRS) captures the choice of values for the parameters that constitute
 * the degrees of freedom of the coordinate space. The fact that such a choice has to be made,
 * either arbitrarily or by adopting values from survey measurements, leads to the large number
 * of coordinate reference systems in use around the world. It is also the cause of the little
 * understood fact that the latitude and longitude of a point are not unique. Without the full
 * specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates are ambiguous at best and
 * meaningless at worst.
 *
 * <h3>Spatio-temporal CRS</h3>
 * The concept of coordinates may be expanded from a strictly spatial context to include time.
 * Time is then added as another coordinate to the coordinate tuple. It is even possible to add
 * two time-coordinates, provided the two coordinates describe different independent quantities.
 * An example of the latter is the time/space position of a subsurface point of which the vertical
 * coordinate is expressed as the two-way travel time of a sound signal in milliseconds, as is
 * common in seismic imaging. A second time-coordinate indicates the time of observation, usually
 * expressed in whole years.

     *   ISO 19111 defines this method for {@code SC_SingleCRS} only. GeoAPI declares this method in
     *   this parent interface for user convenience, since CS dimension and axes are commonly requested
     *   information and will always be available, directly or indirectly, even for {@code SC_CompoundCRS}.
