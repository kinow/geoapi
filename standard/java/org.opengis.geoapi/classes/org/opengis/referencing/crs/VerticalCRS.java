/**
 * A 1-dimensional coordinate reference system used for recording heights or depths. Vertical CRSs make use
 * of the direction of gravity to define the concept of height or depth, but the relationship with
 * gravity may not be straightforward.
 *
 * <p>By implication, ellipsoidal heights (<var>h</var>) cannot be captured in a vertical coordinate
 * reference system. Ellipsoidal heights cannot exist independently, but only as inseparable part
 * of a 3D coordinate tuple defined in a geographic 3D coordinate reference system.</p>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * Some applications may relax the above rule and accept ellipsoidal heights in some contexts.
 * For example as a transient state while parsing <a href="../doc-files/WKT.html">Well-Known Text 1</a>,
 * or any other format based on legacy specifications where ellipsoidal heights were allowed as an
 * independent axis. However implementors are encouraged to assemble the full 3D CRS as soon as they can.</div>
 *
 * <p>This type of CRS can be used with coordinate systems of type
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.VerticalCS}.</p>
