 * A coordinate reference system that is defined by its coordinate

 * Derived CRS are not directly associated to a {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.Datum datum}.
 *
 * <p>In principle, all sub-types of {@link CoordinateReferenceSystem} may take on the role of either source or
 * derived CRS with the exception of a {@link GeocentricCRS} and a {@link ProjectedCRS}. The latter is modelled
 * as an object class under its own name, rather than as a general derived CRS of type "projected".
 * This has been done to honour common practice, which acknowledges projected CRSs as one of the best known
 * types of coordinate reference systems.</p>
