/**
 * Description of a spatial and temporal reference system used by a dataset.
 * A reference system contains the metadata required to interpret spatial location information unambiguously.
 * Two methods to describe spatial location are distinguished:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Spatial referencing by geographic identifier.
 *       Geographic identifiers are location descriptors such as addresses and grid indexes.</li>
 *   <li>Spatial referencing by coordinates. This specialized case is handled by the
 *       {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem} subtype.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Reference systems contain the following properties
 * (including those inherited from the {@link IdentifiedObject} parent interface):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@linkplain #getName() name} (e.g. “<cite>WGS 84 / World Mercator</cite>”).</li>
 *   <li>Alternative names or {@linkplain #getAlias() aliases}, sometime used for abbreviations.</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain #getIdentifiers() Identifiers} allocated by authorities (e.g. “EPSG:3395”).</li>
 *   <li>The {@linkplain #getDomainOfValidity() domain of validity} in which this reference system is valid
 *       (e.g. “<cite>World - between 80°S and 84°N</cite>”).</li>
 *   <li>The {@linkplain #getScope() scope} or intended usage for this reference system
 *       (e.g. “<cite>Very small scale mapping</cite>”).</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain #getRemarks() Remarks} about this object, including data source information
 *       (e.g. “<cite>Euro-centric view of world excluding polar areas</cite>”).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @departure historic
 *    This type was defined in ISO 19115:2003 and removed in ISO 19115:2014.
 *    But GeoAPI kept it as a common parent for
 *    {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem} and
 *    {@link org.opengis.referencing.gazetteer.ReferenceSystemUsingIdentifiers}.

     *     <li>ISO 19111:2007 changed the obligation from optional to mandatory
     *         and requires the value to be <cite>"not known"</cite> if the scope is unknown.
     *         GeoAPI lefts the obligation unchanged: optional with {@code null} value for unknown scope.</li>
     *     <li>ISO 19111:2007 changed the multiplicity from singleton to a collection.
