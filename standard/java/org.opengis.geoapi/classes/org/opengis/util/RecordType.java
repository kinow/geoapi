/**
 * The type definition of a {@linkplain Record record}.
 * A {@code RecordType} defines dynamically constructed data type.
 * A {@code RecordType} is identified by a {@linkplain #getTypeName() type name}
 * and contains an arbitrary amount of {@linkplain #getMembers() members}.
 * Members are (<var>name</var>, <var>type</var>) pairs.
 * A {@code RecordType} may therefore contain another {@code RecordType} as a member.
