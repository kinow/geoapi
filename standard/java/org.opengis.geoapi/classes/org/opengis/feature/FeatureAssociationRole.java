/**
 * Indicates the role played by the association between two features.
 * In the area of geographic information, there exist multiple kinds of associations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Aggregation</b> represents associations between features which can exist even if the aggregate is destroyed.</li>
 *   <li><b>Composition</b> represents relationships where the owned features are destroyed together with the composite.</li>
 *   <li><b>Spatial</b> association represents spatial or topological relationships that may exist between features (e.g. “<cite>east of</cite>”).</li>
 *   <li><b>Temporal</b> association may represent for example a sequence of changes over time involving the replacement of some
 *       feature instances by other feature instances.</li>
