 * It provides the following information:</p>

 *   <li>A type, available via the {@code getType()} or {@code getRole()} method provided by the sub-interface.
 *       The {@link PropertyType} defines information about the property.
 *       This includes which Java class the value of the property is an instance of, any restrictions on
 *       the value, <i>etc</i>.</li>
