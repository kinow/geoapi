/**
 * Thrown when an {@link Attribute} value or a {@link FeatureAssociation} does not met the constraints
 * (other than Java class) specified by its type. This exception can be thrown by implementations that
 * perform validity checks. Such verifications happen typically in the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In {@code Attribute}:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>{@link Attribute#setValue(Object) setValue(Object)}</li>
 *       <li>{@link Attribute#setValues(Collection) setValues(Collection)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>In {@code FeatureAssociation}:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>{@link FeatureAssociation#setValue(Feature) setValue(Feature)}</li>
 *       <li>{@link FeatureAssociation#setValues(Collection) setValues(Collection)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>In {@code Feature}:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>{@link Feature#setProperty(Property) setProperty(Property)}</li>
 *       <li>{@link Feature#setPropertyValue(String, Object) setPropertyValue(String, Object)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>

 * <section class="note">
 * <h1>Exception for invalid class</h1>
 * Libraries may throw {@link ClassCastException} instead than this {@code InvalidPropertyValueException} when
 * the given value is not an instance of the expected class (typically {@link AttributeType#getValueClass()}).
 * The reason is that libraries may rely on Java parameterized types, which throws {@code ClassCastException}
 * at runtime when the objects are used in an unsafe way. Libraries may also rely on {@link Class#cast(Object)}
 * or {@link Class#asSubclass(Class)} standard methods, which are designed to throw {@code ClassCastException},
 * or may way to be consistent with all the above.
