/**
 * Defines the structure and content of views of real-world phenomenon.
 * A feature acts as a model of a real world entity. As such it has many similarities to object oriented programming
 * ideas of classes, fields and methods. A {@link org.opengis.feature.FeatureType} is similar to a
 * {@link java.lang.Class} in Java and can contain three kinds of properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.AttributeType} holds information about an attribute
 *       (similar to a {@link java.lang.reflect.Field} in Java).</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.FeatureAssociationRole} defines a relationship a feature is involved in
 *       (aggregation, composition, <i>etc.</i>).</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.opengis.feature.Operation} describes functionality a feature is able to perform
 *       (similar to {@link java.lang.reflect.Method} in Java).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Features containing only attributes constrained to the [1 … 1] cardinality and said
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.FeatureType#isSimple() simple}.
 * Such simple features can also be represented by {@link org.opengis.util.Record} instances.
 *
 * <p>An important aspect of a {@code Feature} is the fact that it is a dynamic data construct defined at runtime.
 * Traditionally the Java programming language represents dynamic data structures using {@link java.util.Map java.util.Map}.
 * One could think of a {@code Feature} as a {@code Map} in which the keys (i.e. the property names) are well defined.</p>
 *
 * <p>Feature types model is described in the {@linkplain org.opengis.annotation.Specification#ISO_19109 ISO 19109}
 * specification. The following table shows the class hierarchy:</p>
 *
 * <table class="ogc">
 * <caption>Feature class hierarchy</caption>
 * <tr>
 *   <th>Types (from ISO 19109)</th>
 *   <th class="sep">Instances (GeoAPI specific)</th>
