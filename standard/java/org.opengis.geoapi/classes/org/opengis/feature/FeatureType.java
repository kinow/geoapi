/**
 * Abstraction of a real-world phenomena.
 * A {@code FeatureType} instance describes the class of all {@link Feature} instances of that type.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Analogy with Java reflection</b><br>
 * compared to the Java language, {@code FeatureType} is equivalent to {@link Class} while
 * {@code Feature} instances are equivalent to {@link Object} instances of that class.</div>
 *
 * <h3>Naming</h3>
 * The feature type {@linkplain #getName() name} is mandatory and should be unique.
 * Names can be {@linkplain org.opengis.util.ScopedName} for avoiding name collision.
 *
 * <h3>Properties and inheritance</h3>
 * Each feature type can provide descriptions for the following {@linkplain #getProperties(boolean) properties}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain AttributeType           Attributes}</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain FeatureAssociationRole  Associations to other features}</li>
 *   <li>{@linkplain Operation               Operations}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In addition, a feature type can inherit the properties of one or more other feature types.
 * Properties defined in the sub-type can override properties of the same name defined in the
 * {@linkplain #getSuperTypes() super-types}, provided that values of the sub-type property are
 * assignable to the super-type property.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Analogy with Java language</b><br>
 * compared to the Java language, the above rule is similar to overriding a method with a more specific return
 * type (a.k.a. <cite>covariant return type</cite>). This is also similar to Java arrays, which are implicitly
 * <cite>covariant</cite> (i.e. {@code String[]} can be casted to {@code CharSequence[]}, which is safe for read
 * operations but not for write operations — the later may throw {@link ArrayStoreException}).</div>
