/**
 * An annotation specifying the stereotype (abstract, datatype, union, <i>etc.</i>) of an interface.
 * The UML class diagrams in ISO/OGC specifications declare some members as abstract, meaning that
 * instances of those interfaces are expected to implement one of their sub-interfaces.
 * While there is nothing like "abstract interface" and "concrete interface" in the Java language,
 * we nevertheless communicate ISO/OGC intent using this annotation.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are not required to represent "abstract interfaces" by Java abstract classes.
 * This annotation is provided merely for informative purpose for testing tools, implementations
 * based on Java reflection, or widgets among other usages.</p>
 *
 * <p>If this annotation is not present, then the default value is {@link Stereotype#TYPE}.</p>
