 * <p>This enumeration is closely related to the ISO 19115 {@link org.opengis.metadata.Datatype} code list,
 * but not identical since ISO 19115 specifies <cite>datatype</cite> and <cite>stereotype</cite> as two
 * distinct information. Furthermore {@code Stereotype} needs to be defined as an {@code Enum} for
 * allowing usages in Java annotations</p>
 *
 * <p>This enumeration does not include the <cite>code list</cite> and <cite>enumeration</cite>
 * stereotypes, because instances of those types are identified by the
 * {@link org.opengis.util.CodeList} and {@link Enum} base classes respectively.</p>
