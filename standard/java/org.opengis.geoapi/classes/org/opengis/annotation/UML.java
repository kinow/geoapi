     * The vast majority of non-deprecated GeoAPI methods leave {@code UML.version()} to its default value,

     * However there is a few exceptions when an older version of an OGC or ISO standard is preferred.
     * Examples:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@linkplain Specification#ISO_19115 ISO 19115}:2003 defined {@code PT_Locale} in a way closer
     *       to the {@link java.util.Locale java.util.Locale} model than the newer ISO 19115:2014.</li>
     *   <li>An {@linkplain Specification#ISO_19111 ISO 19111} revision by OGC defined geographic and geocentric CRS
     *       in a more type-safe way than ISO 19111:2007. The later model requires C/C++ {@code union} construct for
     *       type-safety, which does not exist in the Java language.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return the specification version, or 0 for the default (usually latest) specification.
