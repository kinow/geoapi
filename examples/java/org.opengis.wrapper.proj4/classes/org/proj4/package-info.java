/**
 * Wrappers for the <a href="http://proj.osgeo.org/">{@literal Proj.4}</a> library. A copy of this package exists also
 * in the <a href="http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj/trunk/proj/jniwrap/">jniwrap</a> directory of the Proj.4 project.
 * This GeoAPI package differs from the Proj.4 package in the following (note that this is a compatible difference):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.proj4.PJException} extends {@link org.opengis.referencing.operation.TransformException}
 *       instead than {@link java.lang.Exception}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This package is for internal use by the {@link org.opengis.wrapper.proj4} package. It should
 * generally not be used directly, unless an implementor wants more direct access to the Proj.4
 * functions.
