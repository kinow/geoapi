 * <h1>Installation</h1>
 * GDAL needs to be built with the {@code --with-java} option.
 * If the package manager for a given platform does not support this option,
 * then GDAL may have to be <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints">built from the sources</a>:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Make sure that the {@code JAVA_HOME}Â environment variable is defined</li>
 *   <li>Run on the command-line:<ul>
 *     <li>{@code cd gdal}</li>
 *     <li>{@code ./configure --with-java=yes}</li>
 *     <li>{@code make}</li>
 *   </ul></li>
 *   <li>Optionally run the command-line as a super-user: {@code make install}</li>
 *   <li>Verify with {@code gdalinfo --version}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * See {@code configure --help} for a list of options.
 * For example MacOS users may need to add the {@code --with-macosx-framework} option at configuration time.
