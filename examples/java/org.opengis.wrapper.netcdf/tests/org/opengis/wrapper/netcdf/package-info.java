 * Tests the <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/geoapi-netcdf">GeoAPI-netCDF bindings</a>.
 * Other projects can leverage the test cases defined in this package by sub-classing
 * and overriding the {@code wrap(â€¦)} method. For example another netCDF wrapper
 * implementation could test their metadata wrapper as below:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>public class MyTest extends NetcdfMetadataTest {
 *    &#64;Override
 *    protected Metadata wrap(NetcdfFile file) throws IOException {
 *        return new MyWrapper(file);
 *    }
 *}</pre></blockquote>
