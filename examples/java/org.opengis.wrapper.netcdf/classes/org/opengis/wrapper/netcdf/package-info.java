/**
 * GeoAPI implementation as wrappers around the
 * <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/">netCDF</a> library.
 * This package provides adapters allowing usage of the following netCDF services
 * as an implementation of GeoAPI interfaces:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Metadata services, as wrappers around {@link ucar.nc2.NetcdfFile}.</li>
 *   <li>Referencing services, including:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>Coordinate Reference Systems as wrappers around the netCDF {@link ucar.nc2.dataset.CoordinateSystem} object.</li>
 *       <li>Coordinate Operations as wrappers around the netCDF {@link ucar.unidata.geoloc.Projection} object.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
