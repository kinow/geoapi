GeoAPI examples

  An example of a very simple GeoAPI implementation. This implementation is not complete, but
  can be used as a starting point for implementors. Since every files in this module are placed
  into the Public Domain, anyone is free to do whatever they wish with those files.

    * See also the {{{../geoapi-proj4/index.html}Proj.4 bindings}}
      and {{{../geoapi-netcdf/index.html}NetCDF bindings}}
      for more examples in the public domain.


* Metadata

  The <<<org.opengis.metadata>>> package and sub-packages contain a large amount of interfaces,
  which may give the impression that implementing metadata is very tedious. However the
  <<<java.lang.reflect.Proxy>>> class can provide dynamically generated implementations.
  The metadata example in this module shows how to implement every metadata interfaces
  with only two small classes.


* Referencing

  The ISO 19111 model contains lot of details, some of them being ignored by existing libraries.
  For example some libraries make no distinction between:

    * <Ellipsoid> and <Geodetic Datum>

    * <Coordinate System> and <Coordinate Reference System>

    * <Coordinate Operation> and <Math Transform>


  This <<<geoapi-examples>>> module follows the path of simpler libraries by merging different
  ISO concepts in the same class. While this is not a recommended approach for strict ISO 19111
  compliance, the intent is to demonstrate that implementors can hide some of the ISO 19111
  complexity.
